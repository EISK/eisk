# Awesome Cloud Architecture

While building a scalable system is lot more easier with the advent of cloud technologies, identifying the right fit can be challenging. Usually it may take years of solid experience in architectural space. 

Here weâ€™ve tried to summarize a list of top technologies that can be used to build scalable systems efficiently. 

Few fundamental or basic considerations, such as programming/scripting languages, operating system choices, additional tooling etc have been intentionally ignored to make the list simple.

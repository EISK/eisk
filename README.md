The primary purpose of this starter kit is, to provide a solid guideline with respect to building enterprise level projects, by utilizing new asp.net and Sql server features, as well as latest best coding practices.

Since its first release, by April 2008, this open source project gained a huge popularity in the developer community and had 1, 75,000+ combined downloads.

This starter kit is honored to be placed at the official ASP.NET site, along with other Asp.Net starter kits, which all are being considered as the “Best” Asp.Net coding standards, recommended by Microsoft.
